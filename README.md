# password-dongle
Combine one-line menu, capacitive touch buttons, keyboard emulation, Morse code input,  
and tiny encryption to make a password dongle in MicroPython on a Trinket M0

This combines code from my other repos:

one-line menu  
https://github.com/dnsbob/one-line-menu  

capacitive touch buttons and keyboard emulation (Human Input Device - HID)  
No repo, code mostly from the demo program that came with the Tricket M0 Micro    
Morse code input  
https://github.com/dnsbob/read-morse-code-from-hand-entry  
The threebuttonmorsecode.py version

tiny encryption  
https://github.com/dnsbob/tinyencrypt  

2020-12-26 Finally fully functional    

todo:
- document the hardware (which button is which pin)
- pictures of the hardware
